### 2.2 Product Features

UniPDF Studio is organized into four modules. Together they cover everyday PDF work, intelligent assistance, and collaboration without overwhelming new users.

• Module 1 — Universal File Support and Editing: Upload common formats (PDF, DOCX, images, text, HTML) and edit directly in the browser. Core tools include text formatting, annotations, shapes, image placement, form fields, and links; actions are undoable and feel responsive on typical devices.

Supporting points:
- Common tasks: highlight passages, correct typos, insert images, add a signature field
- Exports preserve layout; fillable forms remain interactive

• Module 2 — AI-Powered Intelligence: Summarize long documents, ask questions in plain language, and quickly rewrite text to be simpler, more formal, shorter, or more detailed. When possible, answers reference specific pages and correct basic OCR mistakes.

Supporting points:
- Summary lengths (short/medium/long); typical responses in 3–10 seconds
- Page citations appear when context allows; usage limits visible to users

• Module 3 — OCR and File Management: Detect scanned pages, recognize text in 50+ languages, and produce searchable PDFs or text exports. Routine operations like merge, split, rearrange, compress, watermark, and protect are available from one place.

Supporting points:
- OCR targets ~90%+ accuracy on clear 300 DPI scans; exports to searchable PDF or TXT/DOCX/MD
- Visual previews for merge/split/reorder before applying changes

• Module 4 — Collaboration and Cloud: Sign in with email or Google, store files in the cloud, share with view/comment/edit permissions, and collaborate in real time with presence, comments, and version history. Export to standard formats when you’re done.

Supporting points:
- Share by link or specific emails with view/comment/edit roles
- Live edits appear for collaborators in under a second for small teams; quick version restore
### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

Students use the app occasionally to edit assignments, run OCR on scanned notes, and combine handouts; they need simple tools that work quickly without setup.

Business professionals rely on it more regularly for contract review and secure sharing; consistent formatting, collaboration, and protection options matter most to them.

Educators use it throughout the week to annotate, grade, create simple forms, and organize materials for students; clarity and reliable export are key.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

The application runs in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on laptops or desktops with at least HD resolution and a stable connection. The backend uses Node.js with Express, MongoDB for data, Firebase/AWS for storage and auth, and integrates PDF.js, Fabric.js, pdf-lib, Tesseract.js, and OpenAI for document rendering, editing, OCR, and AI features. Containerized deployment on common cloud providers is supported.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

We assume a stable connection, a modern browser, and typical files under ~20MB. Core dependencies include Firebase (auth/storage), MongoDB Atlas, OpenAI for AI features, and Tesseract/Google Vision for OCR. To manage risk, we pin versions, keep regular backups, cache expensive AI calls, provide fallbacks for auth and OCR, and design for graceful degradation during third‑party outages.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Module 1: Universal File Support and PDF Editing

The system accepts common document and image formats, supports drag‑and‑drop upload with validation, and renders pages smoothly for navigation and zoom. Users can edit text, annotate, draw shapes, insert images, and build simple forms; changes apply instantly and can be undone. Export preserves layout and, when forms are used, keeps fields interactive.

Acceptance summary: handles large documents reasonably (up to ~100MB), shows responsive editing, and provides clear upload and export feedback.

Key checks:
- Upload validation and progress indicators are accurate and easy to follow
- Edited PDFs export with preserved layout and any created form fields

### 3.2 Module 2: AI-Powered Document Intelligence

Users can summarize long files, ask questions grounded in the document, and rewrite selected passages to fit a desired tone or length. The assistant cites pages when possible and respects practical usage limits to control cost and load.

Acceptance summary: typical responses return in a few seconds; summaries capture main ideas; quotas and rate limits are visible to the user.

Key checks:
- Answers reference relevant pages when possible and stay grounded in the document
- Quota messages appear before limits are reached and explain reset timing

### 3.3 Module 3: OCR and File Management

Scanned pages are detected automatically, processed with OCR in multiple languages, and exported as searchable PDFs or plain text. Common file operations—merge, split, reorder, rotate, compress, watermark, and protect—are offered in a single flow with previews before committing.

Acceptance summary: OCR is accurate on clear scans, operations complete promptly on medium‑sized files, and original quality is preserved where expected.

Key checks:
- OCR confidence is surfaced; preview shows recognized text before saving
- Merge/split/reorder offer undo and do not degrade image/text quality unnecessarily

### 3.4 Module 4: Collaboration and Cloud Features

Users sign in with email or Google, store documents in the cloud, and share by link or email with view/comment/edit permissions. Real‑time collaboration shows presence and live updates, and a simple version history allows review and restore of earlier states.

Acceptance summary: login and sharing are quick, edits propagate in near real time for small teams, and version previews and rollbacks are reliable.

Key checks:
- Sharing clearly reflects permission levels (view/comment/edit) in the UI
- Version restore provides a preview and completes without data loss
---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

The app should feel fast on typical broadband: pages load within a few seconds, tools respond instantly, and medium documents open and render smoothly. Server throughput is sized for steady student/professional usage with background workers for heavy tasks like OCR, keeping the UI responsive.

Support:
- Target page load ≈ 3s on a 20 Mbps connection; tool activation ≈ 100 ms
- Background workers offload OCR/exports to keep interactions snappy

### 4.2 Security

Passwords are hashed, sessions are token‑based, and all traffic is encrypted. Files at rest use strong encryption, input is validated and sanitized, and access is enforced server‑side so users only see what they’re allowed to share or edit.

Support:
- TLS 1.3 in transit; AES‑256 at rest; bcrypt for password hashing
- Strict input validation and permission checks on every API call

### 4.3 Usability

New users can complete basic tasks in minutes with a short guided tour and helpful tooltips. Frequent actions have shortcuts, recent files are easy to find, and autosave prevents work loss. The UI follows accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA) and supports dark mode.

Support:
- 5‑step onboarding highlights core actions; autosave runs every ~30 seconds
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigation/editing; contrast and ARIA labels validated

### 4.4 Reliability and Availability

We target 99.9% uptime with redundancy for app servers and databases, automatic failover, and graceful degradation if a dependency is down. Backups run regularly and are stored in multiple regions; errors are logged with context and retried when safe.

Support:
- Redundant app nodes and DB replicas with automated failover
- Daily full backups with incremental snapshots and regional redundancy

### 4.5 Scalability

The service scales horizontally with load balancers and read replicas. Storage uses cloud backends and a CDN for global delivery. As usage grows, pooling and sharding strategies can be adopted without redesigning the app.

Support:
- Auto‑scaling adds capacity based on CPU/memory thresholds
- CDN serves static assets and large files closer to users
